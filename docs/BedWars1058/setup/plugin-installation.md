Installing plugins is easy. 

Download the [BedWars1058.jar](https://polymart.org/resource/1152) file and put it in your `plugins` folder. It will be located in the server's folder. Now start the server or restart it, if it's already started and that's it. If you want to continue with setting it up, [click here](creating-arenas) for a tutorial. In any case, if you need help with configuration files, check out the sidebar.

**For better performance**, please read about [SlimeWorldManager Support](../hooks/swm-hook).
