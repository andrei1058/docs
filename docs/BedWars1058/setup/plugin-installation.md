Installing plugins is easy. 

Download the [BedWars1058.jar](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/50942/) file and put it on your `plugins` folder. It is located in the server's folder. Now start the server or restart it if it's already started, and that's it. If you want to continue with setting it up, [click here](creating-arenas) for a tutorial. In any case if you need help with configuration files check on the sidebar.
