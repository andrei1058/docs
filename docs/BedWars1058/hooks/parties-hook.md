## Parties by AlessioDP
**BedWars1058** is providing [Parties](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/3709/) (by AlessioDP) support since version 0.8 beta (API 11).

If a player makes a party and then joins a BedWars game, BedWars1058 will put them in the same team.

Just install the Parties plugin on the BedWars server and that's it :smile:. You can additionally 
 configure the minimum party rank allowed to select an arena.
