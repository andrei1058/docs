The `upgrades2.yml` file contains the configuration for the Upgrades NPC.
### Upgrades Main Menu
The default path is `default-upgrades-settings`.
This is a list of content to be displayed in the GUI. 
`default `stands for [arena group](https://wiki.andrei1058.dev/docs/BedWars1058/setup/arena-groups), so if your [arena group](https://wiki.andrei1058.dev/docs/BedWars1058/setup/arena-groups) doesn't have a custom `<groupName>-upgrades-settings` it will use the default one.
You can use a category or an element in multiple upgrade menus.
```yaml
default-upgrades-settings:
  menu-content:
  - category-name1,1
  - upgrade-name1,2 #The integer after comma is the slot where to place the content in the Upgrades GUI.
  - separator-name1,5,6,7 #Multiple commas to put the element in multiple slots.
  # The first trap the team buys will have this price. (If the target trap haven't got a fixed price).
  trap-start-price: 2
  # Once a team buys a trap the trap-start-price will be incremented with this price. 2+2=4 next 4+2 etc.
  trap-increment-price: 2
  # Currency types: emerald, diamond, iron, gold, vault (for money)
  trap-currency: diamond
  # trap queue limit
  trap-queue-limit: 3
```
**Creating a custom menu for your arena group:**
1. First of all read the above text because you need to understand how it works.
2. Create a new line in `upgrades.yml` and write `<groupName>-upgrades-settings:` where `<groupName>` is your [arena group](https://wiki.andrei1058.dev/docs/BedWars1058/setup/arena-groups) (example: solo, doubles).
3. Now add elements to your category like wrote above, under `menu-content`.


*Result:*
```yaml
solo-upgrades-settings:
  menu-content:
  - category-name1,10
  - category-name2,11
  - upgrade-name3,12
  # The first trap the team buys will have this price. (If the target trap haven't got a fixed price).
  trap-start-price: 2
  # Once a team buys a trap the trap-start-price will be incremented with this price. 2+2=4 next 4+2 etc.
  trap-increment-price: 2
  # Currency types: emerald, diamond, iron, gold, vault (for money)
  trap-currency: diamond
  # trap queue limit
  trap-queue-limit: 3
```

### Upgrades Category

```yaml
category-example-1:
  # This is the category item in the menu.
  display-item:
    # This is the material type.
    # Check the links bellow for a list of materials.
    material: IRON_SWORD
    # Data is used for version 1.12 or older.
    # It is a number that usually indicates the item color.
    data: 0
    # The amount of stacked items.
    amount: 1
    # Set to true/ false to give the enchantment effect.
    enchanted: false
  # These are the elements displayed when you open this category.
  # You can only use upgrade and separator elements.
  category-content:
  - upgrade-name1,4 #Add a comma followed by a number to specify the slot where to put the element.
  - separator-name5,1,2,3 #Add multiple numbers separated by comma to put the element in multiple slots.
