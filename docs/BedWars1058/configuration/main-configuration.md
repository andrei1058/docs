This page contains the documentation about the `config.yml` file located in `plugins/BedWars1058`.

Make sure you're using the right material name when changing item materials in config.

```yaml
# There are 4 choices for this option:
# 1. MULTIARENA it means that you can run multiple arenas on a single paper/spigot server instance.
# 2. SHARED it means that you can run multiple arenas on a single paper/spigot server instance 
#   which have other minigames on it. Lobby world is not protected by BedWars1058 in this case.
# 3. BUNGEE allows you to run multiple arenas on a single server and to keep them connected to an external
# lobby. When a game starts the arena is cloned (auto-scale) in order to have always free arenas.
# 4. BUNGEE_LEGACY it means that you can run a single arena on a paper/single spigot server.
#   When you join the server it will add you to the arena. Server motd is changed based on the arena status.
serverType: MULTIARENA

# This is used as default language for your BedWars server.
# It is "language: en" by default. It means that English is the default message for your server and it takes
# messages from "plugins/BedWars1058/Languages/messages_en.yml".
# You can add your own language to the server by creating a new `yml` file.
# Let's suppose you want to add the Romanian language. Create a new file called "messages_ro.yml",
# copy the messages from "messages_en.yml" and then translate them.
# If you want to set Romanian as the default server language set this option to "language: ro".
# Players can do "/bw lang en" to receive messages, GUIs and holograms in their preferred language.
# This won't affect the others players.
